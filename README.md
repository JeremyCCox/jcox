Along with being a personal blogspot, This web application serves as a testbed for my Node.js packages as they are developed.

Those packages include:

- jman-web-tokens
- [jman-article-framework](https://github.com/JeremyCCox/jman-article-framework)
- [jman-docker-workflow](https://github.com/JeremyCCox/jman-docker-workflow)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
